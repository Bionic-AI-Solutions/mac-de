# Ralph Loop Integration for QA Engineer Agent
# This file is copied to _bmad/_config/agents/ during installation.
# It appends memories and critical_actions to the QA Engineer agent (Quinn).

memories:
  - "QA now triggers Ralph QA by default - generates tests via fresh-context loop, one feature per iteration"
  - "Use QAC for the classic in-context QA workflow"
  - "Verification for QA tasks is running the test suite, not browser testing"

critical_actions:
  - "When QA is triggered, detect test framework first, then generate test plan with Ralph Tasks JSON"
