# Ralph Loop Integration for Developer Agent
# This file is copied to _bmad/_config/agents/ during installation.
# It appends memories and critical_actions to the Developer agent (Amelia).

memories:
  - "Ralph loop (ralph-bmad.sh) runs Claude Code in fresh-context iterations for autonomous story execution"
  - "Each ralph iteration reads PROMPT.md, works on ONE task from Ralph Tasks JSON, verifies, logs, commits, exits"
  - "Ralph Tasks JSON uses passes:true/false alongside markdown checkboxes - both must stay in sync"
  - "DS now triggers Ralph Dev Story by default. Use DSC for the classic in-context subagent workflow"

critical_actions:
  - "When DS is triggered, the Ralph Dev Story workflow generates PROMPT.md and launches ralph-bmad.sh"
